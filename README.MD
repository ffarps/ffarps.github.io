## My Personal Website

### Pure HTML and CSS, with a touch of Javascript

## What I've Learned

- Making a web portfolio from scratch
- Put into practice some html and css knowledge
-

## Future work

- Project pages UI overhaul
- Hosting a new Portofolio in a hosting service that supports front and back end, but for now, it works, it just works.
- Backend for adding and editing of projects and sending messages in contact

for now, the sending of messages is handled by using an endpoint from formsubmit.co, to deactivate the form: https://formsubmit.co/help;
